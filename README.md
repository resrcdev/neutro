# ⃝ Neutro

Full Stack Web Platform Framework

## Vision

Built upon [Web Components](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_components), Neutro offers the closest experience to the web platform for authoring web apps. The vision is minimalism and portability — avoid magical abstractions and enabable more code reuse, even if it wasn't built with Neutro in mind. It's the web the way that it was meant to be.

## Current Status

This repository will serve as an experiment for a decent amount of time for now, but we hope to start publishing some packages very soon.

You can run the current demo:

```sh
nvm install
npm install
npm run demo
```

Nothing is polished yet. Take a look at the `demo` directory for the code.
